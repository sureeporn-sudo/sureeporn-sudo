👩‍💻 About Me

I’m an IT student currently building my foundation in software development and quality assurance.  
As a beginner in the IT field, I’m focused on learning core concepts such as programming fundamentals, object-oriented design, and software testing through hands-on practice and academic projects.

I enjoy exploring how software works behind the scenes—especially writing unit tests, identifying edge cases, and improving code quality. I believe that strong testing and attention to detail are essential parts of building reliable software.

At this stage of my journey, I’m actively working on small projects, coursework, and practice exercises to strengthen my skills and gain real-world experience. I’m motivated, curious, and always eager to learn from feedback and challenges.
